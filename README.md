# Sky-Heart
Welcome! This is an app I made for my girlfriend and thought it would be fun to post on GitHub!

# How to Use
First and foremost, you must install the dependencies. This can be done with:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Next, you must set the environment variables in .env / You can find your API Keys at:
  https://openweathermap.org/price (click the free option)
  https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard (note: Spotify Premium is required)

Within the script, there are variables that are modifiable, and is meant to be personalized for the person
that you give the script to! Change temperature, time, pictures, to suit the person you love :)

After you modify what you need to, set your environment variables, and install the dependencies, you are
done! Run using
  python3 script.py
while in the directory of the script.
